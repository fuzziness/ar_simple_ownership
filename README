== ArSimpleOwnership (v 0.2.0)

The ArSimpleOwnership Plugin extends ActiveRecord::Base to add automatic updating
of an ownership attribute of your models in much the same way that the 
ActiveRecord::Timestamp module updates created(at/on) and updated(at/on) attributes.

Needs Rails 2.1


=== Install

Installing the plugin can be done using the built in Rails plugin script. 
Issue the following command from the root of your application:

  script/plugin install ar_simple_ownership


=== Uninstall

  script/plugin remove ar_simple_ownership


=== Example

@TODO


=== Bugs & Feedback

Bug reports and feedback are welcome via my email[michele.franzin@gmail.com] address.
I also encouraged everyone to clone the git repository and make modifications.
I'll be more than happy to merge any changes from other people's branches that 
would be beneficial to the whole project.


=== Todo

* Every find call adds automatically owner scope
* Store classes with full path
* Customizable owner id column
* Support for Composite Primary Keys


=== Credits and Special Thanks

The original idea for this plugin came from Delynn Berry's 
{userstamp plugin}[http://delynnberry.com/projects/userstamp/].
