== ArSimpleOwnership (v 0.1.0)

The ArSimpleOwnership Plugin extends ActiveRecord::Base to add automatic updating
of an ownership attribute of your models in much the same way that the 
ActiveRecord::Timestamp module updates created(at/on) and updated(at/on) attributes.

Needs Rails 2.1+



== Todo

* Store classes with full path

* Customizable owner id column

* Support for Composite Primary Keys

* don't allow multiple calls of manage_ownership 


== Uninstall

Uninstalling the plugin can be done using the built in Rails plugin script. 
Issue the following command from the root of your application:

  script/plugin remove ar_simple_ownership


== Documentation

RDoc has been run on the plugin directory and is available in the doc directory.


== Running Unit Tests

There are extensive unit tests in the "test" directory of the plugin. These test can be run
individually by executing the following command from the ar_simple_ownership directory:

 ruby test/owner_test.rb
 ruby test/ownable_test.rb
 ruby test/manager_test.rb
 ruby test/books_controller_test.rb
 ruby test/comments_controller_test.rb
 ruby test/manager_test.rb


== Bugs & Feedback

Bug reports and feedback are welcome via my email:michele.franzin@gmail.com address. 
I also encouraged everyone to clone the git repository and make modifications.
I'll be more than happy to merge any changes from other people's branches that 
would be beneficial to the whole project.


== Credits and Special Thanks

The original idea for this plugin came from Delynn Berry's 
{userstamp plugin}[http://delynnberry.com/projects/userstamp].
